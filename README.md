## What it does

- **Recon / VA**: one straight pipeline, `subfinder (optional) -> httpx -> naabu -> nuclei`, plus
  conditional **nuclei wordfence** templates for hosts detected as WordPress. All-Go tools.
  Per-finding CVSS / CVE / references, AI enrichment, and a triage status workflow.
- **Passive recon & exposure (Attack Surface)**: key-less OSINT discovery - **VirusTotal** (passive
  DNS: subdomains, undetected URLs, IP resolutions / origin-behind-WAF) + **Wayback Machine** (archived
  URLs). Discovered URLs are categorised by file type (backups / configs / keys / db-dumps / …) and
  scanned by a 23-rule **exposure detector** (AWS / GCP / GitHub / Slack / Stripe keys, JWTs, private
  keys, DB URLs, basic-auth, stealer/combo creds, …). Scan **modes**: `active` (binaries), `passive`
  (OSINT only, no traffic to target), `full` (passive → feed → active). Exposure findings feed the
  unified risk score; credential-class hits cross-link to leaked credentials.
- **Threat Intelligence**: OTX AlienVault + LeakCheck + manual indicators + sector security news
  (RSS, including Indonesian sources) + a unified **risk score** (with a passive **Exposure**
  component) that is identical across the dashboard, the TI page, and the reports.
- **AI Penetration Test** (planned): authorized, AI-driven pentesting via a separate offensive engine
  ([vacti-pentest-engine](https://github.com/anggipradana/vacti-pentest-engine)) on Kali. vacti is the
  control plane (engagement console, findings, evidence, bilingual pentest report); the engine pulls
  authorized engagements, runs an in-scope agent swarm, and writes findings + human-grade evidence
  back. See the **AI Pentest** menu for the in-product preview.
- **Reports**: redesigned bilingual (EN/ID) PDF reports for VA and TI (cover, table of contents,
  donut + bar charts, subdomain inventory, vulnerability summary, finding cards, approval sheet),
  rendered with headless Chromium. Per-project branding (logo, colours, classification, signatories,
  executive summary).
- **Scans**: start / cancel, **scheduled** (cron), **sub-scan** (partial rescan), **diff** two scans,
  live SSE progress, full command + activity audit.
- **Platform**: multi-project workspaces, **RBAC** (SysAdmin / PenetrationTester / Auditor) enforced
  server-side, encrypted **API-key vault** (AES-256-GCM), audit log, universal search.
- **Integrations**: webhooks (Discord rich embed, Google Chat card, Slack, Telegram, generic),
  automatic alerts on high-severity findings and new leaks, **AI** enrichment + executive-summary /
  threat-narrative generation (Claude / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Kimi / Ollama), and a first-class typed REST API with
  OpenAPI docs.

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router) and React 19, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, tRPC + Hono + Zod, PostgreSQL + Drizzle
ORM, **pg-boss** (queue stored in Postgres, no Redis), Vercel AI SDK, Playwright (e2e **and** PDF
rendering), argon2id password hashing, an Nx monorepo, and Vitest.

```

The web app serves the UI and the REST API; the worker consumes jobs from the queue and shells out to
the Go scanners. See [`docs/explanation/architecture.md`](docs/explanation/architecture.md).

The planned **AI Penetration Test** capability adds a second, optional runtime: the
[vacti-pentest-engine](https://github.com/anggipradana/vacti-pentest-engine) on Kali. It is a separate
deploy unit (not one of the three services) that reaches vacti **outbound only** to pull authorized
engagements and write back findings + evidence; vacti stays the lightweight control plane.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version        | Notes                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js     | 22 or newer    | the whole stack is TypeScript                            |
| PostgreSQL  | 16 or newer    | data store and job queue                                 |
| Go scanners | latest         | `subfinder`, `httpx`, `naabu`, `nuclei` on `PATH`        |
| Chromium    | via Playwright | PDF rendering and e2e; installed by `playwright install` |

The four ProjectDiscovery scanners are only needed for real scans (the rest of the app runs without
them). Install them with Go:

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest   # needs libpcap-dev
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
nuclei -update-templates                                              # fetch templates once
# ensure $(go env GOPATH)/bin is on your PATH
```

### Set up the project

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone <repo-url> vacti && cd vacti
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium          # for PDF rendering + e2e

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
#    Generate the encryption key and paste it into .env:
openssl rand -base64 32                   # -> ENCRYPTION_KEY (32-byte base64)

# 3. Create the database (example role vacti / vacti)
createuser vacti --pwprompt              # or use an existing role
createdb vacti -O vacti
#    set DATABASE_URL=postgres://vacti:vacti@localhost:5432/vacti in .env

# 4. Run migrations and seed the default scan profiles + keyword list
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# 5. Start the worker and the app (two terminals)
npx tsx apps/worker/src/main.ts          # terminal 1: job worker
npx next dev apps/web -p 3100            # terminal 2: web app + API
```

Open <http://localhost:3100>. There is no separate registration step: the first visit shows a
**"Create the first admin"** form, and that account becomes the SysAdmin.

> Shortcut: `make install` installs deps, `make migrate && make seed` prepares the DB, and `make dev`
> runs the app and worker together. `make help` lists every target.

---

## Tutorial: your first scan

A five-minute walkthrough once the app is running at <http://localhost:3100>.

1. **Create the admin.** On first load, fill the email + password form. You are now signed in as
   SysAdmin.
2. **Create a project.** Go to **Settings -> Projects**, enter a name (`Acme Corp`) and a slug (`acme`),
   and click _Create project_. Projects are the workspaces that scope everything below, so you can run
   many engagements side by side.
3. **Add a target.** Go to **Targets**, pick the active project in the top-right switcher, enter a
   domain (`example.com`). Optionally paste predefined subdomains (this skips subfinder) and custom
   request headers (sent by httpx and nuclei).
4. **Run a scan.** Go to **Vulnerability Assessment**, click _New scan_, choose the target and a profile
   (Quick / Standard / Deep), and start it. The detail page streams live stage-by-stage progress and
   you can cancel at any time.
5. **Triage findings.** Open the finished scan. The Vulnerabilities tab lists findings with severity,
   CVSS/CVE, and a one-click _On Progress_ review toggle plus a full status dropdown. Use the status
   filter and _Mark all reviewed_ for bulk triage. Click _AI_ on a finding for an enriched
   description / impact / remediation (needs an AI key).
6. **Generate a report.** Click _Generate report_ to stream a branded bilingual PDF.
7. **Threat intelligence.** Go to **Threat Intel**, pick the project, and _Refresh_ to pull OTX
   reputation, leaked credentials, and sector security news. Choose your sector to filter the news,
   triage leaks and headlines, then generate the TI report.

## Using the platform

| Area                         | What you can do                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Start (active / passive / full mode), cancel, sub-scan, diff two scans, and AI-enriched findings triage.                                                            |
| **Targets**                  | Add domains, predefined subdomains, and per-target custom request headers; recon notes.                                                                             |
| **Attack Surface**           | Passive OSINT results: discovered URLs (file-category filter), exposure findings (masked snippet + triage), IP directory.                                           |
| **Cyber Threat Intel**       | OTX + LeakCheck + monitored-asset reputation (VT/OTX verdicts) + sector/brand news + passive exposure, all feeding one risk score.                                  |
| **AI Pentest** (planned)     | Authorized AI-driven pentesting: engagement console, in-scope agent swarm, human-grade evidence, bilingual report. Runs on the separate engine; preview in-product. |
| **Reports**                  | Branded EN/ID PDF for VA and TI, with signatories, classification, and executive summary.                                                                           |
| **Settings**                 | Projects, scheduled scans (cron), scan profiles, API tokens, webhooks, AI provider + key vault, users/RBAC, audit log.                                              |

RBAC: **SysAdmin** (full control), **PenetrationTester** (run scans, modify findings),
**Auditor** (read-only). Enforced server-side on every mutation.

## API reference

Every endpoint is under `/api` and (except the three public ones) requires a Bearer **API token**.
Create a token under **Settings -> API tokens**. Interactive docs live at **`/api/docs`** (Redoc) and
the raw spec at `/api/openapi.json`.

```bash
export TOKEN=vct_xxx
export BASE=http://localhost:3100/api
auth=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")
json=(-H 'content-type: application/json')
```

### Example: scan a target end to end

```bash
# 1. Create a target in a project
curl -s "${auth[@]}" "${json[@]}" -XPOST "$BASE/targets" \
  -d '{"projectId":"<project-uuid>","domain":"example.com"}'

# 2. Start a scan (omit profileId to use the worker default)
curl -s "${auth[@]}" "${json[@]}" -XPOST "$BASE/scans" \
  -d '{"targetId":"<target-uuid>"}'

# 3. Watch progress (SSE) or poll results
curl -s "${auth[@]}" "$BASE/scans/<scan-id>/events"
curl -s "${auth[@]}" "$BASE/scans/<scan-id>/results"

# 4. Diff against an earlier scan
curl -s "${auth[@]}" "$BASE/scans/<scan-id>/diff?against=<older-scan-id>"
```

Errors use standard codes: `401` (missing/invalid token), `403` (RBAC denied), `404` (not found),
`400` (validation, with a Zod issue list).

---

## Reports

Reports are HTTP routes that stream a PDF (open them in the browser or `curl -o`):

```text
GET /reports/va/<scanId>?type=full&lang=id     # vulnerability assessment
GET /reports/ti/<projectId>?lang=en            # threat intelligence
```

`type` can be `full` or `summary`; `lang` is `en` or `id`. Branding (logo, colours, classification,
signatories, executive summary) is configured per project under Settings. Reports never use em dashes
and the layout follows the BPRS-Hijra reference design.

Per-project keys set in the encrypted vault (Settings -> Integrations) take precedence over these
environment defaults.

### AI enrichment with a custom / compatible endpoint

By default Anthropic and OpenAI talk to their official cloud APIs. You can point them at any
**OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible** endpoint instead - a local proxy, an internal gateway,
[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), or [claude-code-router](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router) -
without touching the rest of your setup.

1. Open **Settings -> Integrations -> AI enrichment**.
2. Pick the **Provider** (Anthropic or OpenAI) and the **Model** name your endpoint expects.
3. Set **Base URL** to your endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:4000/v1` (LiteLLM) or your gateway's
   base path. Leave it **blank** to use the official cloud API.
4. Put the API key your endpoint expects in the **encrypted vault** (same page) for that provider -
   or in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The Base URL only changes _where_ requests go; the
   key field is unchanged.
5. Save, then click **AI** on any finding to verify enrichment works against your endpoint.

Notes:

- The Base URL is **per project** and optional; it never affects other projects or your API keys.
- It must be a full `http(s)://` URL (invalid values are ignored and fall back to the cloud default).
- For a **fully local** model use the **Ollama** provider instead, configured via `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
  (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- This lets you route enrichment through a gateway backed by your own Claude credentials, so you are
  not limited to a separate pay-as-you-go API key.

## Testing and QA

Three tiers plus end-to-end (see [`docs/how-to/run-tests.md`](docs/how-to/run-tests.md)):

```bash
npm run test:quick        # unit (Vitest)
npm run test:integration  # integration (needs Postgres)
npm run e2e               # Playwright e2e (headless)
npm run e2e:ui            # Playwright UI mode (interactive, headed/desktop)
```

CI runs typecheck + lint + all three tiers behind a quality gate.

---

## Docker and deployment

```bash
make up      # app + worker + Postgres (migrations auto-run)
make down    # stop the stack
```

Designed to sit behind a **Cloudflare Tunnel** (no inbound ports). See
[`docs/how-to/deploy.md`](docs/how-to/deploy.md) and
[`docs/planning/03-API-AND-DEPLOY.md`](docs/planning/03-API-AND-DEPLOY.md).

## Project layout

```text
apps/        web (Next.js), worker (pg-boss)
libs/        @vacti/{core,config,db,auth,queue,ui,recon,threat-intel,reports,api,integrations}
.claude/     ccpm planning: prds/ and epics/<name>/{epic.md, 00N.md} (incl. the ai-pentest plan)
repo-governance/  six-layer governance (vision to workflows)
docs/        Diataxis docs (tutorials/how-to/reference/explanation) + planning decision records
drizzle/     SQL migrations (0000+)
```

The planned **AI Penetration Test** engine lives in its own repository,
[vacti-pentest-engine](https://github.com/anggipradana/vacti-pentest-engine) (offensive runtime on
Kali, with its own governance). Its feature plan stays here under `.claude/prds/ai-pentest.md` and
`.claude/epics/ai-pentest/`.

## Security and scope

Only scan **authorized** targets. Secrets live only in `.env` or the encrypted vault and are never
logged or committed. RBAC is enforced server-side on every mutation. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
Out of scope for v1: bug-bounty sync, screenshots, heavy OSINT, multi-org, proxying.
