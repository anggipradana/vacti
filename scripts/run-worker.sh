# Supervised worker runner — for running the worker directly on a host (bare-metal / WSL dev).
# The canonical production deployment is Docker Compose (docs/how-to/deploy.md), where the worker
# service uses `restart: unless-stopped` for the same effect; this script is the non-Docker equivalent.
#
# The worker processes scans, threat-intel refreshes and the schedule tick. If it exits for any
# reason (crash, OOM, host hiccup) with nothing to restart it, in-flight scans get orphaned and sit
# in "running" forever. This wrapper restarts the worker automatically with capped backoff so jobs
# keep flowing; the worker's own startup reaper + live watchdog then clean up anything that stalled.
#
# Config is read from the environment (or a local, git-ignored .env) — never hard-code secrets here.
#   Required: DATABASE_URL, ENCRYPTION_KEY, SESSION_SECRET
#   Optional: OTX_API_KEY, LEAKCHECK_API_KEY, SCAN_MAX_RUNTIME_MS
# Usage: scripts/run-worker.sh
