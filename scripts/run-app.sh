# Supervised production web server — bare-metal/WSL equivalent of the Docker `app` service.
# The canonical production deployment is Docker Compose (docs/how-to/deploy.md), where the app
# service uses `restart: unless-stopped`; this script is the non-Docker equivalent for this host.
#
# IMPORTANT: this serves a PRECOMPILED production build via `next start` — NOT `next dev`. Dev mode
# recompiles every route per request and ships unminified JS, which made heavy pages (e.g.
# /scans/[id]) slow on the live domain. Build first (`next build apps/web`, or scripts/rebuild-app
# flow) into the dist dir this serves, then run this. Restarts with capped backoff so the site
# self-heals after a crash/host hiccup.
#
# Config is read from the environment (or a local, git-ignored .env) — never hard-code secrets here.
#   Required: DATABASE_URL, ENCRYPTION_KEY, SESSION_SECRET
#   Optional: PORT (default 3100), NEXT_DIST_DIR (default .next-prod), OTX_API_KEY, LEAKCHECK_API_KEY
# Usage: scripts/run-app.sh
